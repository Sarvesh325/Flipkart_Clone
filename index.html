          Moving to a new place is never easy, especially if you're buying new furniture. Beds, sofa sets, dining tables, wardrobes, and TV units - it's not easy to set up everything again. With the hundreds of options thrown at you, the ride could be overwhelming. What place is reliable, what furniture will stand the test of time? These are questions you must ask before you choose a store. Well, our Durability Certified Furniture Store has not only curated a range of furniture keeping in mind the modern Indian consumer but furniture that comes with a lab certification, ensuring they last you for up to 10 years. Yes, all our furniture has gone through 35 stability and load tests so that you receive only the best-quality furniture. Be FurniSure, always. Names to look out for are Nilkamal, Godrej Interio, Urban Ladder, Home Town, Durian and Perfect Homes.
          You may have your furniture all set up, but they could end up looking flat and incomplete without complementary decor. Curtains, cushion covers, bed sheets, wall shelves, paintings, floor lamps - find everything that turns a house to an inviting home under one roof at Flipkart. <br>
